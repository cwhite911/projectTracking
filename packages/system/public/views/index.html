      <p>CADD Services is a section within the Design / Construction Division. This section includes a CADD Services Manager, two CADD Specialists, and three Senior CADD Technicians.</p><p>The CADD Services staff provides the Design / Construction Division and its customers with a variety of services including (but not limited to) engineering automation, large scale digital scanning, technical support, problem solving, and training.</p><p> The CADD Services staff works directly with the Project Engineers and Survey staff within the Public Works Department of the City of Raleigh. Our goal is to produce standardized maps for Street Improvements, Assessments, Petitions, Annexations and RW Plats.</p><p> All drawings and maps are produced in MicroStation V8i and GeoPak formats. AutoCAD, ArcGIS, Microsoft Word and Excel are some related software packages used by the CADD staff as needed for design purposes. All construction plans and drawings conform to either the City of Raleigh specifications or to the latest edition of the NCDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Structures.</p><p>Staff within this section are also responsible for managing the Public Works Department map files which have been converted to a digital format. This conversion has improved efficiency by reducing the time required to locate and view maps and reducing the space required for map storage.</p>
